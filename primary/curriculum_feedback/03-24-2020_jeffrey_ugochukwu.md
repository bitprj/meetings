Agenda
-Volunteer Feedback Response to BitCart Winter2020 activities. Discussion of organzitions and ways to improve BitCart and Volunteer experience.

During Meeting How was your experience with BitCart? Is there a specific activity that you think could be improved upon? What do you think about the organization and the preparation of the activities? What do you think about the powerpoint slides? Are the slides helpful when explaining to kids in the classroom? How suitable is the information from each slide to the activity? What do you think about the font? What do you think about the visuals of the slides? How well could the kids answer the questions? What are some ways that we can improve to make the volunteer experience more beneficial and fulfilling?<

Update Discussion Points: Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans Organization of materials were fine, but needs more preparation to explain to volunteers and train volunteers

could use five mins before activity begins for volunteer leads to demonstrate to other volunteers how the activity should go
provide a rough timeline/outline on how the activity should go Powerpoint slides
standard slide, not the most visually appealing
kids with shorter attention span could have a harder time focusing
too many words and not enough pictures Training
Training on how to work with kids
how to get the class and the volunteers to get more engaged in the activity
