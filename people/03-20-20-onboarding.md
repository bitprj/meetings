## Updates:
*What has been completed and can be checked off*
* Minh Tu made the onboading checklist
* Becca made the People and Marketing checklist
    
## Discussion points:
*Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans*
* Should the recruiting process be the same to remote school and Davis students?
* Daniel needs to figure out MDX deck 
* We want to figure out the process ASAP because there is one school waiting
* Figure out intro tasks for new developers 
* school workshop proposal: List of key concepts covered, Interactive component / game, Outline for slides within Proposal
* Why would people from other schools only with people from remote people and not students from Davis? 
    Shreya thinks it causes inclusion and Daniel agrees. Make some remote people reviewers based on their skills rather than just make all Davis members reviewers. 
* Find internal feedback software 
    
## Action Plan:
*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*
* Make an airtable for mentor and mentee 
* New members will do a workshop instead of creating a whole curriculum 
* Talk to reviewers if they think people changing teams is okay with them
* By tonight figure out what each team does/ mission/ why are remote now/ team breakdown. Put this all on the slides 
* We need to communicate better on what we need 
    
## Deliverables:
*Within the next (timeframe)*
* Shreya document GitBook how Github in relations in the People team. Onboarding. Convert checklist to GitHub
* Minh Tu works on documenting how Hubspot works and school proposals 
* Becca works on communication webinar
