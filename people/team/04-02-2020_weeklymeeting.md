## Discussion Points:

### New Member Issue
- [ ] New member hasn’t get much chance to know other teams. 
- [ ] New members don’t know what the team has done in the past, and need more explanations to be on the same page with other people in the team. 
- [ ] Need to figure out a better way to communicate with new members, so when they join teams they don’t feel lost. 

### Work Assign
- [ ] Things being assigned are due really quickly, and don't have much time to do. Making sure there is a good amount of time to do the work before the deadline reaches (try assign the work earlier)
- [ ] There seems to be discrepancies in what we were being told to do versus what had on the developers Bible. The developers bible needs to be up to date with the work assigned.
- [ ] There aren't many explanations of why certain work is assigned to someone, just assigned in slack without much details. Make sure there is enough explanations.
- [ ] There is a lot of changing in formatting of the work. 

### Overall Picture
- [ ] Confusion with the overall picture of the whole BitProject organization. (Some people attend the last Town Hall meeting said that it was very useful since this issue has been addressed. keep that for our future Town Hall meetings since there is still some confusion occur)

### Platform transition
- [ ] There are a lot of transitions between the platforms that they are using (just trans to GitHub). Make sure there is an explanation of how to use the new platform when we doing the transition.

## Action Plan:
*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*
* Managers should explain previous work to new members before assigning new work (bring them up to date), include a summary of everything have done so far in the past to show the new member.
* Talk to the specific manager of the team for which team member come up with the issue of works assigned due really quickly, to see what happened.
* When attending weekly meetings, **make sure that the team have at least some knowledge about the road map**. If they don't know about the road map, have the manager of that team explain as well.
* When there is issue about work assigned without enough explanations, make sure the assigner had the enough communication with the the people he assigned work to before the deadline. Always let the assigner ask about how is the work going during the process, and including any confusions, what has done already so far. 
* All the issues being addressed should directly raise up into an GitHub issue to attract attention. So everyone can see it and know what the expections are.
* When a work is assigned, an issue is raised (also when there is an issue with the developers issue), a project need to do done, talk in slack first and when come up with a decision, put it directly on GitHub.
* Try to have more people to speak up during Town Hall (frequently bring up a question slide, pause for a long time to let others speak up).
* Attending meetings every two week this month, and do it every 3 weeks after this month.
* All the managers should receive a pdf or mark down feedbacks file according to their group, with the recommendations from the people team. Attach a markdown file to each corresponding teamon GitHub.

## Deliverables:
