## Discussion Points:
*Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans*
**New Member Issue**
- [ ] New member hasn’t get much chance to know other teams. 
- [ ] New members don’t know what the team has done in the past, and need more explanations to be on the same page with other people in the team. 
- [ ] Need to figure out a better way to communicate with new members, so when they join teams they don’t feel lost. 
**Work Assign**
- [ ] Things being assigned are due really quickly, and don't have much time to do. Making sure there is a good amount of time to do the work before the deadline reaches (try assign the work earlier)
- [ ] There seems to be discrepancies in what we were being told to do versus what had on the developers Bible. The developers bible needs to be up to date with the work assigned.
- [ ] There aren't many explanations of why certain work is assigned to someone, just assigned in slack without much details. Make sure there is enough explanations.
- [ ] There is a lot of changing in formatting of the work. 
**Overall Picture**
- [ ] Confusion with the overall picture of the whole BitProject organization. (Some people attend the last Town Hall meeting said that it was very useful since this issue has been addressed. keep that for our future Town Hall meetings since there is still some confusion occur)
**Platform transition**
- [ ] There are a lot of transitions between the platforms that they are using (just trans to GitHub). Make sure there is an explanation when we transition to a new platform
