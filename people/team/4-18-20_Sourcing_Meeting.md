## Updates:
*What has been completed and can be checked off*

* Owen has created a presentation to discuss the future of sourcing. 
* Goals: Flush out the interview process, solidify sourcer job description, recruit for sourcing team, and recruit for key positions.

## Discussion Points:
*Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans*
* The plan is to implement a three step process. 
* First, the interview lead and department will establish questions for the interview and qualities that they want. 
* Second, the interviewer and sourcer responds to the prospective team member and makes the primary decision if the person is admitted. 
* Third, the interview lead and department head will make the final decision to decide if the person should be at Bit. 
* Goals of sourcing is to reach out to specific people who wouldn't normally apply. 
* The first few steps are to contact the department heads to idenify ideal qualities, create email templates for the reach out process, create an ID system for applicants, and create a standard form of communication. 
* To start, we need to go to job posting sites and search for those key traits and experiences. It's important we don't contact the same person more than once. 
* Quotas are flexible, right now we are aiming at contact 5x the amount of positions that need to be filled. 
* It's important to use Airtable to update the status of the people who we reach out to. 
* When people are interested, it's important to send them the application. 
* Sourcers are expected to carry out about 5 interviews per week. 
* We look for sourcers to have key communication skills and are likeable. 

## Action Plan:
*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*
* Establish an interview team within People Department. 
* Cement the interview process. 
* Establish an ID system within Bit.
* Cement the Sourcer job description. 
* Expand the team. 


## Deliverables:
*Within the next (timeframe)*
* Reach out to people for Assistant Director of Content with email template. 
* Meet with department heads to get key qualities and interview questions.
* Have interview process solidified by Wednesday, April 22nd.
* Start holding interviews on Saturday, April 25th.
