Talk more about the program:

- High school only program, where students will get a chance to work on their own IMC, which is an integrated marketing campaign. Meaning different sections or team works together to promote and create an end product. In this case, students will choose a prompt to work on as a team of 8. Through out the journey they will make interactive technical blogpost and promote the webinar at the end. The webinar will be led by students. This program will consist of 3 teams led by a project manager who is also a high student. During the first week or week 0 they will be trained by Daniel Kim.
