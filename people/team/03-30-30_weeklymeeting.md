Discussion Points:

We can work to improve sourcing by reaching out to specific organizations at other universities.
We should start to target specific universities and try to grow there as opposed to reaching as many as possible.
Collin gave an overview of eduflow and what it is used for. 
Onboarding going well, but people forgetting to check off boxes.
Jasmine came up with a way to keep track of OKRs and relayed this information over to the team. 
We went over what happens when someone is underperforming.
Winnie went over feedback and solutions.
People have pointed out issues in navigating GitHib. 
New members suggest to condense the content of webinars. 
We decided it might be best to make more shorter videos instead of less longer ones. 
Some people have found it hard to complete the onboarding tasks in a short period of time. 
We agreed that people can always ask if they need an extension.
We clarified that everyone is inivted to join beginner-level positions.
Twitter team is concerned that when contacting professers, they are not replying. We agreed that email is still the best option.
Parents who we reach out to for feedback are not always responding to us. Shreya will attend next primary work session to discuss and figure out solutions.
Writing team wasn't clear on the tasks they were given. Winnie will send a message to clarify these things.

Collin to keep doing eduflow and onboarding, as well as telling people to close issues when they are done. 
Jasmine will continue to develop evaluation process. 
Winnie will keep collecting meeting feedback.
