## Updates:
*What has been completed and can be checked off*

* Update1

## Discussion Points:
*Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans*

* OKRs are helpful since it gave a clear direction of what need to complete in a week and also in a month, helps with time management. 

**GitHub Issue**
* A lot of people have point out that navigating GitHub is really hard. Suggestion: have a simpler to-do app that could have people assign work and have a clear calendar with all the assignments need to be done would be really helpful. Also simplify the meeting notes template. 


**Onboarding**
* New members suggest to condense the content of the webinars to make it shorter. (Diversity and feedback webinars had been point out)

* Extend the dealine to complete the onboarding process, the work is hard to complete in 3-4 days. 
*Suggestion: seperate the onboarding process into different parts, so new members don't see a big list of tasks that need to be complete and get scared. Give an appropriate timeline to finish each part. When finished, check in with their managers and managers could give them the 2nd part.*

* The template of onboarding should be simplified into the lead part and member part. Before the onboarding lead to actually onboarding someone, it would be helpful to have a meeting with the lead to go through the checklist first.

**Outreach**
* IMC: Twitter team is concerned about when contacting the professors, they are not replying. 
* PrimaryEd: Parents that we reach out for feedback are not answering us. My teammate points out that we could have a simpler google form that contains short answers which only take about 2 minutes to fill out.

**Writing Team**
* So far, the directions of the tasks being assigned weren't really clear, so there is a lot of confusion during the process of completing the tasks. They suggest that having all the directions and goals either written on a list or discussed during a meeting would be really helpful for everyone in the team.


## Action Plan:
*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*
*next week OKRs*
* Minh-Tu: create an onboarding training for new onboarding associates so they have a clear sense of what need to do. Please create some short clips walking them through where to find the templates through GitHub and how to use Airtable and such
* Collin: Please continue improving the eduflow! It looks great right now. Also continue editing the email template after you have a good draft of the eduflow course. The email template should include the following: Interview information (calendly of sourcer), a disclaimer saying “schedule interview within 3 days. If you have to cancel the meeting for any reason, please do 24 hours in advance. You can get rid of the steps. keep the first paragraph and the last paragraph of the original template. Also please update the onboarding checklists for the marketing team, please refer to the people onboarding checklist and you can basically copy it except the have a different task.
*Katie: please help adding the interview questions (to the doc above) that you think would help best assess a person’s skill. It will help us find them the best position in Bit. Also I can show you the process trmw if you are free. Contact again 20 different schools. And start holding interviews!
*Jasmine: Please work on the performance evaluations procedure. Merge the procedure through gitbooks. Work on how OKR are going to work. Ask Daniel to teach you about ZenHub. Since your main objective is to increase the percentage of completion of OKRs in the future. And let me know if there is anything else you are interested in working on!
*Winnie: Thanks for the feedback that you have been collecting! its really great!!! Please keep doing that, and recording them. Continue to make solutions for them along the way.

*Feedback next steps*
* Will have plan on introducing zenhub to everyone, which might make the github much easier to navigate
* When someone feels the onboarding process is too long or they are having some issue completing it, they could ask the manager to give them some more time.
* Onboarding webinars will be cut into several shorter videos.
* when onboarding someone, it would be helpful to ask them do they want to stay in Bit, and also ask about what position they actually want. People with the position they want will more likely to engaged in hard-working.
* Ask every manager to publish their team meetings to BitProject calendar
* when someone seems like having a lot of negative feedbacks, it would be better to set up a 1-1 after to talk with them to see what we can help them with.

## Deliverables:
*Within the next (timeframe)*
