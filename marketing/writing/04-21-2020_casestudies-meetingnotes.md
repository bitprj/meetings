## Updates:
*What has been completed and can be checked off*

* New assignments for writing team- 3 case study articles for the newsletter TBR by Monday

## Discussion Points:
*Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans*
* 3 case study articles done for newsletter to be published this Mon
* Task Overview: Write step-by-step instructions about code curriculum w/ developers; esp intro and conclusion; devs will write out the steps and writers go proofread them.
* To do: Contact the developers you’ll be working with to set up a meeting time and work on the drafts.
* Use Jupiter Notebook example
* Allie: Amazon sentiment w/ Julia- Analysis of what ppl write in reviews vs star ratings on Amazon
** Design requests: people shopping
* Vibha: COVID-19 data graph visualization w/ Chris
** Design requests: Interaction w/ map
* Vicky: Political debate w/ Michelle
** Design requests: People on podiums/TV w/ politicians
* INTRO- talk about the way data sci connects to more abstract concepts
** EX: polisci is relatively vague and abstract; we’re using data science to quantify 
* BODY- this will be more instructional like a curriculum card, devs will write a rough draft of the instructions while writers work on intro and conclusion, and then writers will proofread the instructions and add any missing info/clarification
* CONCLUSION- summarize the study and why it’s important and relevant to the progression of both data sci and whatever non-STEM subject the study focuses on
* Questions (for Polisci Debate): Explain Twt API; how does it filter by location?

## Action Plan:
*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*
* OVERALL DUE DATE: SUNDAY NIGHT
* DUE DATE FOR INTRO/CONCLUSION/HOW IT RELATES TO SUBJECT MATTER (1ST DRAFT): SATURDAY NIGHT
* Design team graphics request for Twitter case study- Vicky will interview Kevin on Friday (afternoon), Shreya will discuss w/ Daniel to flesh out the outline before then to get a headstart; projected due date: sometime after next Mon
