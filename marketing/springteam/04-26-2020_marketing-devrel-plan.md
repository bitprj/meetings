## Updates:
*What has been completed and can be checked off*

* The overall direction of Bit and what our content should entail. **please read the following points** to read up on how we are going to drive our **clout** and **marketable content:**
  - **Bit's primary goal is to create clout for everyone involved in Bit**
  - DevRel's focus will now be blogposts first, and then workshops. There is a 3 week lifecycle for blog, after which marketing should wait 3 weeks to determine if workshop should be developed.
  - If marketing deems a blog is marketable, a workshop will be created from that blog and there will be a 2 week lifecycle for that workshop
  - Workshops will only be made from blogs that are deemed successful by the marketing team
  - For marketing a workshop, there needs to be 3-4 supplementary blog posts that are tangentially related to the workshop at hand. these blog posts should be taken from related blog posts that have been made already, and the goal of all these blog posts will be to invite them to a workshop
  - In the future, the marketing team will provide recommendations on workshops to the DevRel team to develop based on what blogs performed well
  - all directors and managers should write 1 blog post a month, either about a project they are working on (engineering/devrel) OR how their team is run (Marketing/people)
