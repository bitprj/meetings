## Updates:
*What has been completed and can be checked off*

* Update1

## Discussion Points:
*Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans*
* -Eden: reach out to Davis data science professors, eden will expand criteria. Hard to find grad students. Finished onboarding. Finished personas (Data Sci/stats professor), haven’t done interviews yet. Thus, no insights. Professors want to teach how they teach but no capabilities. 
-Monica: Found university contacts, did basic persona, look for ppl to reach out to for interviews. Professors urged to research, esp in socio professors.
-Su Ting: haven’t reach out to professors yet, edit questions. 
-our competitive advantage: allow non-stem students gain “research” opportunities 
-professors want to teach new ways bc students bored of traditional teaching, they like the applicability
-personas aren’t used to search for ppl, rather how we respond to them. Depending on major of professor, tailor our emails of known pain points of that persona.
-What are your pain points when you’re teaching your class
-How do you keep students engaged
-what we want for content on bitproject.com/datascience. Twitter case study. 
	-information about data science applicabilities
	-things to solve their painpoint//case study about
	-growing trend of data science in industry 
	-What we tryna find from interviews: learn more info to complete the persona
	-Reason we interviewing: understand pain-points with their teaching curriculum.
