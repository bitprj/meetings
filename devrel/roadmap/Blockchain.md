**Start Meeting**

* Updates: what has been completed and can be checked off
* Discussion: ideas, feedback, concerns, plans
* Action Plan: where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines
* Deliverables: within the next (timeframe)

## Updates:

*What has been completed and can be checked off*

* Reminder on why road map is necessary
  * Plan to on-board other schools
* Outlining expectations
  * We are planning *modules* 
    * A module covers a specific subject in curriculum
    * Each module should be finished in a week

## Discussion points:

*Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans*

* Share Lucidchart with everyone
* Each module in road-map needs to have set of learning objectives and a (preliminary) list of activities and labs
* Discuss which "areas" to include in our road-map from the above guide
  * "Area" = more general topic like Relational Databases, Web Sockets, etc.
  * We need to then set up modules in each area
* John Long will discuss his preliminary roadmap
* Discussion and feedback on John's roadmap
* How to move forward
  * Can other members of BoD contribute to this?

## Action Plan:

*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*

* John (and BoD if applicable) should work on fleshing out the road-map 
  * For each module, there should be learning objectives and (preliminary) activity and lab names
* Example of what **one module's** breakdown should look like:
  * Module: Intermediate Python
    * Learning Objectives
      * Students will continue applying their fundamental Python skills learned from the previous module.
      * Students will begin learning about how to integrate basic data structures like lists and dictionaries to add complexity to their Python code.
      * Students will learn how they can use for/while loops and if statements to control the flow of their code.
      * Students will learn how to represent strings in Python using F-strings.
    * Activities
      * Bookkeeper
      * Creating a Menu
      * Message Cipher
    * Labs
      * Word Translation Calculator
      * Basic Calculator
      * Tic-Tac-Toe
  * **Note that for this example, Intro to Python is a topic and there can (and should) be multiple topics for a module. The above example was just for one module of Python: Intermediate Python.**
  * Module breakdowns will be placed on our Wiki and represented on our road-map!
* Modules should also be in **Lucidchart**

## Deliverables:

*Within the next (timeframe)*
