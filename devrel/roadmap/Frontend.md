**Start Meeting**

* Updates: what has been completed and can be checked off
* Discussion: ideas, feedback, concerns, plans
* Action Plan: where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines
* Deliverables: within the next (timeframe)

## Updates:

* Reminder on why road map is necessary
  * Plan to on-board other schools
* Outlining expectations
  * We are planning *modules* 
    * A module covers a specific subject in curriculum
    * Each module should be finished in a week

## Discussion points:

* Share Lucidchart with everyone
* Start on road-map
  * Using this as a guide https://roadmap.sh/backend
* Each module in road-map needs to have set of learning objectives and a (preliminary) list of activities and labs
* Discuss which "areas" to include in our road-map from the above guide
  * "Area" = more general topic like Relational Databases, Web Sockets, etc.
  * We need to then set up modules in each area
* Preliminary idea of what to cover in the road-map: 
  * Topic: Internet (covered by Backend team)
  * Topic: HTML/CSS Basics
    * Advanced HTML/CSS
    * Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
  * Topic: JavaScript
    * Basics of JS
    * Extra JS: Fetch API + AJAX + ES6
  * Topic: Version Control Systems (covered by Backend team)
  * Topic: Package Managers
    * npm, yarn
  * Topic: build tools
    * npm scripts
    * Webpack
  * Topic: React and Redux
  * Topic: Modern CSS
    * Styled Components
    * CSS Modules
  * Topic: CSS Frameworks
    * Bootstrap
    * Reactstrap
    * Material UI
  * Topic: Testing apps
  * Topic: Progressive Web Apps
  * Topic: GraphQL
  * Topic: Static Site Generators
    * Gatsby.js
    * Next.js
  * Topic: Mobile Apps
    * React Native
  * Topic: Desktop Apps
    * Electron
* Outline expectations for each module on road-map from each manager
  * Learning objectives, activity names, lab names, all in GitBooks

## Action Plan:

*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*

* Split up different parts of back-end programming road-map to be done by **Monday**, **3/23**
* Example of what a module breakdown should look like:
  * Module: Intermediate Python
    * Learning Objectives
      * Students will continue applying their fundamental Python skills learned from the previous module.
      * Students will begin learning about how to integrate basic data structures like lists and dictionaries to add complexity to their Python code.
      * Students will learn how they can use for/while loops and if statements to control the flow of their code.
      * Students will learn how to represent strings in Python using F-strings.
    * Activities
      * Bookkeeper
      * Creating a Menu
      * Message Cipher
    * Labs
      * Word Translation Calculator
      * Basic Calculator
      * Tic-Tac-Toe
  * **Note that for this example, Intermediate Python is a topic and there can (and should) be multiple topics for a module. The above example was just for one module of Python: Intermediate Python.**
  * Module breakdowns will be placed on our Wiki and represented on our road-map!
* Modules should also be in **Lucidchart**

## Deliverables:

*Within the next three days*

**NOTE:** for all modules, there should be **3-4 learning objectives**, **4-5 sample activity names** and **2-3 sample lab names**

- Note that labs can technically have same content but different premises
