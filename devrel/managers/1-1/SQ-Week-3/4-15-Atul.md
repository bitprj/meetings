* Atul Jayaram

## Updates:
*What has been completed and can be checked off*

* Made a Code Sandbox tutorial + how Sandbox should connect with branches
  * https://about.bitproject.org/teams/developer-relations/setting-up-code-sandbox
  * Motivation: Wanted to streamline workflow of QA + get everyone working within Code Sandbox in an organized manner

## Discussion Points:
*Ideas, feedback, concerns, plans*
* .mdx files should only be added **in the existing decks folder**
* Discussing Tutorial
  * How to QA
* Getting Duos on Same Page
* Status of current PR

## Action Plan:
*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*
* Clean up existing pull requests so that I (Kevin) only have to QA .mdx files **inside of the decks repository**
  * Assets should still be added of course
  * No new folders!
* Have both duos set up Code Sandbox and their branches with the instructions
* Make clear to duos what kinds of changes there have to be

## Deliverables:
*Within the next (timeframe)*
