      - Preliminary Idea of Deadline
        - Fri - proposal 
          - Ideas for concepts
          - Splitting up code into deliverable items
            - Manager works with devs to iron out code deliverables over 1-3 weeks
            - Code related to concepts should be prioritized first, done by Week 3
          - Planning out slides
        - manager should be checking in constantly to ensure the proposal is mostly done 
        - Sun - slides for Idea/Motivation done
    - Part 2: Concepts + Introduction (Week 2)
      - How concepts influence the existing code/project
      - Fri - code completed 
      - That drive that code
    - Part 3: **Interactive** Tutorial + Slides on Concepts That Drive Tutorial Portion
      - Concepts should be fully completed in Part 3
* Week 4: Lab version
  * Managers should overlook concepts, checkpoints
    * Managers should drill in formatting



* Discuss role of devs and interns in 4-stage plan
* Explain workshop version vs curriculum version
* Discuss process of converting a workshop into a lab
  * Slides should be concept cards fleshed out
  * only workshop is covered, not all code behind it
  * Guidelines
    * Medium and Easy cards wouldn't be a thing
    * General Items apply
    * Stage 1 - Starting Content applies
      * Starter Code
    * Stage 2 - Finishing Content applies
      * Checkpoints (not as many code checkpoints - doesn't make sense for most workshops)
    * Stage 3 - Finishing Touches applies
    * Stage 4 - For Reviewers Only applies
  * Not everything from current curriculum framework has to be integrated: what is necessary and what is not? 
  * Example: checkpoints are needed as there can be slides asking the audience a question, which can be converted in a short answer checkpoint

## Action Plan:
*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*
* Plan all-team meeting on Sunday
  * Sarah's team will be first to go through new framework for spring quarter

## Deliverables:
*Within the next few days*
