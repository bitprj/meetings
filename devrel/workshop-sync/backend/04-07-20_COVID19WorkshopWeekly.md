## Action Plan:
*Where to go next, dependencies, all deadlines*

* Specific action plan for how devs will convert slides
  * Follow through the same format as the article and videos
    * Focus more on Backend (Postman) part; assume basic experience with HTML/CSS/JS
  * Make an outline by Wednesday night
  * Focus (in terms of content and interactive activity ) should be on Postman. Assume basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS (don't focus too much of presentation explaining details of this - just high level overview). 
* Discuss with devs to coordinate and confirm the interactive component
  * Display time series data for another value
  * Display time series data for a different country
  * Compare two different countries within the same graph
* Confirm date and time of presentation in Week 3 with head and devs

## Deliverables:
*Within the next 3 days*

* Make an outline of the slides by Wednesday (4/9).

By Friday (04/10/20), each duo needs to submit their "First Draft" pull request completing the issues assigned for Week 1. I will provide feedback by Saturday (04/11/20). "Final Draft" pull request should be in by Sunday (04/12/20).

 There seems to be an issue with mdx for everyone. I will make personal repo so that work can be completed.
